                  Michael spent over 20 years as a senior executive inside major insurance carriers. His job was to evaluate claims and decide which ones got paid — and which ones got denied.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He reviewed thousands of files. He learned exactly what documentation meets the internal approval thresholds, what language carriers accept, and what gaps adjusters exploit to deny valid claims.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Most claims don't fail because the damage isn't real. They fail because the paperwork speaks 'contractor' while the carrier speaks 'policy.' If your documentation doesn't map directly to the internal checklists adjusters use, the claim gets rejected — even when the damage is legitimate.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Michael founded StormChecks to fix that. We build forensic files designed to pass the same tests he used to administer. Not contractor estimates. Not photos without context. Carrier-grade evidence that meets the exact standards insurers use to make decisions.

                Subject: The Money Your Insurance Company Hopes You Never Claim
              </h3>

              <p>
                To my fellow property owners,
              </p>

              <p>
                I spent two decades inside the insurance industry. I've sat in the rooms where claim decisions are made. I've seen the checklists. I've seen what gets approved — and I've seen what gets thrown in the denial pile.
              </p>

              <p>
                Here's what most property owners don't understand: insurance carriers are not in the business of paying claims. They're in the business of collecting premiums and minimizing payouts. If your documentation has a gap — any gap — they will find it and use it against you.
              </p>

              <p>
                I've watched legitimate claims get denied for reasons that would infuriate you:
              </p>

              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 marker:text-accent">
                <li><strong className="font-semibold text-primary">'No storm nexus'</strong> — meaning the paperwork didn't link the damage to a specific weather event</li>
                <li><strong className="font-semibold text-primary">'Insufficient documentation'</strong> — meaning photos without measurements, context, or timestamps</li>
                <li><strong className="font-semibold text-primary">'Pre-existing condition'</strong> — the catch-all excuse for denying anything they don't want to pay</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                The damage was real in every one of these cases. The inspections were accurate. But the documentation didn't check the right boxes — boxes that carriers intentionally don't publicize.
              </p>

              <p>
                After 20 years of watching this happen, I left. I founded StormChecks to give property owners what they've never had: documentation built by someone who knows exactly what carriers need to see to approve a claim.
              </p>

              <p>
                Our forensic files aren't contractor estimates. They're 100+ page evidence packages with NOAA weather data, microscopic damage analysis, storm-to-damage causation narratives, and Xactimate scopes that match carrier internal standards.
              </p>

              <p>
                We find damage that nobody else finds. Then we document it so airtight that carriers can't deny it.
              </p>
              
              <div className="bg-primary/5 border-l-4 border-accent p-6 my-8 rounded-r-lg">
                <p className="font-medium text-primary italic">
                  "Our analysis shows that latent storm damage typically represents $10–$15 per square foot in recoverable loss. For most commercial buildings, that's hundreds of thousands of dollars sitting on the table — money that belongs to you, not your insurance company."
                </p>
              </div>

              <p>
                If your building has been through a storm in the last three years, it's worth two minutes to find out what you're owed.
